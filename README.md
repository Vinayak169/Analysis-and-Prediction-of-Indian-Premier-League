This project was completed as part of the course DS 203 - Programming for Data Science under the guidance of Prof. Amit Sethi, Prof. Manjesh Hanawal, Prof. Sunita Sarawgi and Prof. S. Sudarshan. It was taken up by a group of 4 second year undergraduates.\\
The project contains 5 ipynb files and 1 pdf file which is the project report.
Cricket is perhaps the most popular sport in India and also one of the most popular sports in the world. Of the various cricket tournaments held around the world, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is the most famous domestic league. 
In this project, a two large datasets containing ball by ball data as well as match by match data (2008-2020) are analysed. Both datasets were obtained from Kaggle and have been linked in the report. Various batting and bowling statistics are analysed. We also analysed some general team statistics which are important in cricket. We also analysed some relevant data related to different venues. 
Finally, we use a machine learning algorithm that predicts the result of a match based on factors such as toss results, quality of the teams, venue etc. Three Machine Learning Frameworks are used - Support Vector Machine, MLP Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.
